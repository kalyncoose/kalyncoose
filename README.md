I am currently working at [Compassion, Inc.](https://compassion.com) focusing heavily on test automation. On GitHub, you can find me contributing to [Robot Framework's](https://robotframework.org) [QWeb Library](https://qweblibrary.org). I am also in the design phase for a new open source project [dwemer](https://github.com/kalyncoose/dwemer) which will be [Robot Framework's](https://robotframework.org) first desktop client.
